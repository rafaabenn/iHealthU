## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaabenn/ihealthu.git
cd ihealthu
```

### 2. Start the backend

```bash
cd ihealthu-backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Start the frontend

```bash
cd ihealthu-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## API Endpoints

All routes except `/auth/*` require a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Create a new account |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Login and receive a JWT |
| GET | `/activities` | Get all workouts for the current user |
| POST | `/activities` | Add a new workout |
| PUT | `/activities/:id` | Update a workout |
| DELETE | `/activities/:id` | Delete a workout |
| GET | `/goals` | Get current user's goals |
| PUT | `/goals` | Save/update goals |
| GET | `/health` | Get health log entries |
| POST | `/health` | Add a health log entry |
| DELETE | `/health/:id` | Delete a health log entry |
| GET | `/dashboard/today` | Today's stats and workouts |
| GET | `/dashboard/summary` | 7-day summary and charts |

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `ihealthu-backend/` if you want to override defaults:

```env
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-here
```

The frontend reads the API base URL from an optional `.env` file in `ihealthu-frontend/`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Data Storage

This project uses JSON files as a lightweight database, stored in `ihealthu-backend/data/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `users.json` | Registered user accounts |
| `activities.json` | All workout entries (tagged by `userId`) |
| `health.json` | Health log entries (tagged by `userId`) |
| `goals.json` | Per-user goal settings keyed by `userId` |

> **Note:** These files are committed for demo purposes. In a production environment you would replace this layer with a real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) and add the `data/` directory to `.gitignore`.

---

## Test Accounts

Two accounts are available out of the box for testing:

| Email | Password |
|---|---|
| test@test.com | 123456 |
| sara@test.com | 123456 |

---

## Known Limitations

- No password hashing — passwords are stored in plain text (fine for a demo, not for production)
- JSON file storage has no concurrency protection
- Steps tracking is a placeholder (always shows 0) — would require device/wearable integration
- Water and mood data resets on page refresh (stored in local React state only, not persisted to backend yet)
  (We're still working on these details)
